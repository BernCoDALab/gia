This course provides a basic introduction to the archaeological use of GIS, focusing on the techniques for spatial data collection, management, and visualization, as well as key analysis tools. Participants will gain hands-on experience with GIS, using free and open source software (QGIS) to explore how digital tools can enhance archaeological research.

Students will acquire the skills necessary for a complete GIS workflow, from data management and georeferencing to spatial analysis and cartographic output. The course emphasizes the practical application of these tools to solve significant archaeological questions. It is particularly beneficial for those seeking to integrate GIS into their research or as a foundation for more advanced methods, such as spatial statistics, geospatial analysis, and computer-aided archaeological interpretation.

The course consists of lectures, practical exercises, and tutorials, conducted in the instituteâ€™s computer lab. Assessment will be based on practical assignments and a final exam (theoretical and/or practical).

The course will be taught in English.

# Key dates

Will be made available soon.

# Learning objectives

The objective of this course is to equip you with fundamental skills in cartography, geospatial data management, and spatial analysis, providing a solid foundation for independent work in GIS within archaeology.

By the end of the course, you will:

* Understand the key concepts of geospatial data and cartography.
* Be proficient in using the core functions of QGIS, with skills transferable to other GIS platforms.
* Be capable of creating publication-ready maps using archaeological data.
* Know how to locate, acquire, and manage geospatial data relevant to archaeological research.
* Be familiar with commonly used spatial analysis techniques in archaeological studies.

# Meeting times & locations

### Lectures 
The course is held according to the principle of an ''inverted classroom''. The teaching content is provided by means of videos and other material. Students are encouraged to work on this independently and to deepen it if necessary. I will respond as quickly as possible to questions sent to me via email. The practical consolidation of the content takes place in the Computer Lab, where students work on their own "homework".

### Computer Lab
Wednesday from 14:15-16:00, Seminarraum 324, [Mittelstrasse 43, 3012 Bern](https://goo.gl/maps/ridV1XPk4BLY3bLYA) 

The Computer Lab will be held in presence. During this time, students can implement and deepen what they have learned independently in the context of their own semester projects in group work under the supervision of the lecturer. Your own computer equipment is recommended. If you have any problems in this regard, please let me know in advance. We will work exclusively with free software, if possible with open source solutions.

### Office hours
to be announced

# Pre-requisites

None except motivation and the desire to learn, as well as the readiness to work independently and to collaborate in groups to complete your project.
