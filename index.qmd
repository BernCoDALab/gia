This course provides a basic introduction to the archaeological use of GIS, focusing on the techniques for spatial data collection, management, and visualization, as well as key analysis tools. Participants will gain hands-on experience with GIS, using free and open source software (QGIS) to explore how digital tools can enhance archaeological research.

Students will acquire the skills necessary for a complete GIS workflow, from data management and georeferencing to spatial analysis and cartographic output. The course emphasizes the practical application of these tools to solve significant archaeological questions. It is particularly beneficial for those seeking to integrate GIS into their research or as a foundation for more advanced methods, such as spatial statistics, geospatial analysis, and computer-aided archaeological interpretation.

The course consists of lectures, practical exercises, and tutorials. Assessment will be based on practical assignments and a final exam (theoretical and/or practical).

The course will be taught in English.

# Key dates

Will be made available soon.

# Learning objectives

The objective of this course is to equip you with fundamental skills in cartography, geospatial data management, and spatial analysis, providing a solid foundation for independent work in GIS within archaeology.

By the end of the course, you will:

* Understand the key concepts of geospatial data and cartography.
* Be proficient in using the core functions of QGIS, with skills transferable to other GIS platforms.
* Be capable of creating publication-ready maps using archaeological data.
* Know how to locate, acquire, and manage geospatial data relevant to archaeological research.
* Be familiar with commonly used spatial analysis techniques in archaeological studies.
